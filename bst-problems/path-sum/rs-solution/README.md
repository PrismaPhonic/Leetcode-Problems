## RS Solution

Please see the readme for Path Sum #1 as it has more details regarding the
general approach there (the problems aren't that different).  The only
difference is that instead of returning true early - we push to a paths array
which we return at the end and our recursive function doesn't return anything -
it simply mutates the paths array.
